# Program Structure

## 1. Names
- Begins with a letter, and may have more letters/digits/underscores
- Case matters
- Keywords cannot be used as names (ex. if, switch, func, etc.)
- If name begins with an upper case letter, it is exported (visible and accessible outside of its own package)
- "camel casing"

## 2. Declarations
- var, const, type, and func

```
./boiling
go run main.go
```

```
./ftoc
go run main.go
```

## 3. Variables
