# 1. Hello, World

## package fmt
This package contains functions like Println.

## package main
Function main is where the execution of the program begins. Main will call functions from other packages.
### Note: must import packages used by the program

## declarations
func, var, const, type
A function declaration consists of keyword func, name of function, parameter list (empty for main), a result list (empty), and body of the function (enclosed in braces)

## Semantics
- Semicolons only required when two or more statements/declarations appear on the same line.
- New line can occur after the operator but not before (ex. x + y)

# 2. Command-Line Arguments
## package os
Can access command line arguments in program using os.Args, which returns a slice of strings (similar to lists or arrays in other languages).
